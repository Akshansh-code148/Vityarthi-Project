AI Detector – Project Statement
Problem Statement

With the rapid rise of AI-generated content, distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated text has become increasingly challenging. Educators, researchers, and organizations need a reliable way to check whether a piece of text is likely produced by an AI model.
This project aims to build a basic AI Detector that analyzes text patterns, stylistic markers, and language structures to estimate whether a given input is AI-generated or human-written.

Scope of the Project

The project covers the following aspects:

Development of a simple machine-learning or rule-based model to classify text as AI-generated or human-written.

A user-friendly interface (CLI or web UI) to input text and view results.

Basic evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

Support for English text detection.

Lightweight implementation suitable for academic and beginner-level usage.

Out of scope:

Detecting the exact AI model used.

Detecting multimedia content (images, audio).

Advanced deep-learning pipelines requiring high compute.
 Target Users

Target Users

Students and Teachers – to verify assignment authenticity.

Content Creators – to ensure originality of written content.

Researchers – working on NLP, linguistics, and AI ethics.

Organizations & Recruiters – to validate writing samples or statements of purpose.

General Users – anyone curious about whether text is AI-generated.

High-Level Features

Text Input Module – Users can paste or upload text.

AI-vs-Human Classification – Model predicts likelihood score (e.g., “82% AI-generated”).

Probability/Confidence Score – Displays how sure the detector is.

Highlighting Patterns (optional) – Shows repetitive or unnatural phrases typical of AI.

History/Logs (optional) – Stores past analyses for review.

Lightweight Deployment – Works on local machine with minimal dependencies.
